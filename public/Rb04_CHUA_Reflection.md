### List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences. ###

**HTML TAGS**

   HTML tags are the basic building blocks of a webpage. They are used to structure content like headings, paragraphs, and links. I understand how to use opening and closing tags correectly and how there are elements that can give additional details like links or image sources. Knowing this helps me create simple and well-structured web pages.

**BASIC JS STATEMENTS**

Javascript statements are instructions that the browser executes to perform actions. I know how to use statements like assignments and simple outputs. These statements are the foundation of JavaScript programming.

**SELECTION STRUCTURES**

Selection structures allow a program to make decisions based on the given conditions. I understand how to create conditions using comparison and logical operators. These structures make it possible to control the flow of a program.

**DECLARING JS FUNCTIONS**

Functions in JavaScript are resuable blocks of code that can be executed when called. I can declare functions and know how to pass parameters and returns values. This makes programs more organized and avoids repeatinf the same code multiple times.

**LOOP CONTROL STRUCTURES**

Loop control structures are used to repeat blocks of code until a conditon is met. I know how to use 'while' and 'do..while' loops depending on the situation. These loops are helpful for tasks checking conditions multiple times or going through data.

### List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  ###

**LOOP CONTROL STRUCTURES**

I sometimes get confused about how to use 'break' and 'continue', and nested loops are also tricky. I need more practice to be able to avoid logical errors when using them.

**ARRAYS** 

I know how to create arrays and access elements, but I still need more practice in using loops to go through each element. I also find it challenging to use array methos correctly.

### Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items. ###

I will practice using arrays and loops. I will also read more materials to learn more on how to use them.

### In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why? ###

I think the activities that were effective were the hands-on activities where we would code in the classroom. This allows us to understand what we are doing and we are able to ask questions without waiting for a long time for a response. Another is how we are able to recap what we have learned before moving on to the next lesson as this allows us to recall what we previously learned. I did not find any activities that were not effective hehehe.
